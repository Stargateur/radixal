# radixal

Digits iteration for unsigned integer types.

## Features

This crate can be used without the standard library.

As of this version, no effort has been made to limit this to unsigned 
integer types (`u8`, `u16`, `u32`, `u64`, `u128`, `usize`). Thus, do not 
expect any specific behaviour when used with other types.
